    # config), even though the pre-built wendy binary itself runs fine. wendy
    # works without `container` via Docker or for remote-only device management.

      Attention: The Wendy CLI collects anonymous analytics.
      They help us understand which commands are used most, identify common errors, and prioritize improvements.
      Analytics are enabled by default. If you'd like to opt-out, use the following command:
        wendy analytics disable
      Or, set the following environment variable:
        WENDY_ANALYTICS=false

      To set up MCP integration with your AI tools:
        wendy mcp setup

      s += <<~EOS

        On macOS Tahoe (26) and newer, local Linux containers are powered by
        Apple `container`, installed by default with this formula there. Before
        first use, start its services once:
          container system start
          container builder start
        To skip installing it, reinstall with:
          brew install --without-container wendylabsinc/tap/wendy-nightly
        (`container` has no bottle on older macOS, so it is not installed there.)
      EOS
